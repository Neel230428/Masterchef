Combine about 150 ml warm water, the yeast, and salt in a small bowl, stir and cover. Stand in a warm place for 5 minutes or until bubbles form on the surface. Sift the flour into a large bowl. Make a well in the middle and pour in the yeast, water & salt mixture, olive oil, yoğurt, and the remaining warm water (about 110 ml).

Using your hand, draw in the flour from the sides and work the mixture into a dough. Knead thoroughly to form a soft dough. Divide the dough into 5 pieces, knead them, and roll into balls. Place the balls on a floured surface, cover with a damp cloth, and leave them to rest for about 30 minutes, or until the dough doubles in size.

Meanwhile, prepare the filling. Chop the washed spinach leaves thoroughly. Knead the onions, spinach, olive oil, and red pepper flakes (optional) with your hands for a few minutes. Stir in the feta cheese and combine well.

On a lightly floured surface, roll out each of the balls of the dough with a rolling pin into thin, flat rounds, about 40 cm diameter. Sprinkle a little flour as you roll the dough so that the dough won’t stick. Roll until you achieve a thin flat sheet of dough.

Fold the left and right sides of the dough in a way for the edges to meet in the middle. Spread about 2½ tablespoon filling into the middle part of this flat sheet. Then fold the top and bottom edges over the filling, making sure all the filling is safely covered. Press edges together well to seal. Repeat the same procedure for the rest of the dough balls.

Heat a griddle or a non-stick pan, and brush one side of the gözleme with a little olive oil and place on the pan to cook for about 2 -3 minutes, or until golden brown. Brush the uncooked side with a little olive oil and then flip it over. Cook for another 2-3 minutes, until golden brown. Brush both cooked sides of gözleme with a little olive oil - this will keep the gözleme moist. Cook the rest of the gözleme the same way.

You can either roll the gözleme to serve or you can cut in halves or quarters.
